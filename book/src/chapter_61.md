We mentioned town portals in the design document, and it's becoming obvious how they would help: it's a real slog to travel back to town to sell your hard-earned loot (and possibly save up for upgrades to help against the itty-bitty draconic murderers!).

The basic idea of a town portal scroll is simple: you cast the spell, a portal opens and takes you back to town. You do your thing in town, and return to the portal - and it teleports you right back to where you were. Depending upon the game, it may heal the monsters on the level while they are gone. Generally, monsters don't follow you through the portal (if they did, you could kill the town with a well-placed portal!).
