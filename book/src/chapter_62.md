Magical items are a mainstay of both D&D and roguelikes. From the humble "Sword +1", to mighty "Holy Avenger" - and back again to "Cursed Backbiter" - items helped to define the genre. In roguelikes, it's also traditional to not automatically know what items are; you find an "Unidentified Longsword", and have no idea what it does (or if is cursed) until you find a way to identify it. You find a "Scroll of blahblahblah" (the unpronounceable names seem to be a feature!), and until you identify or read it - you don't know what to expect. Some games turn this into entire meta-games - gambling on frequency, vendor prices and similar to give you clues as to what you just found. Even *Diablo*, the most mainstream roguelike (even if it went real-time!) of them all has retained this play feature - but tends to make Identify scrolls extremely plentiful (as well as helpful old Scotsmen).

## Classes of magic item

It's common in modern games to differentiate magic items as being *magical*, *rare* or *legendary* (along with item sets, which we won't go into yet). These are typically differentiated by color, so you can tell at a glance if an item is even worth considering.
