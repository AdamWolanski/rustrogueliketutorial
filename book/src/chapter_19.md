Hunger clocks are a controversial feature of a lot of roguelikes. They can really irritate the player if you are spending all of your time looking for food, but they also drive you forward - so you can't sit around without exploring more. Resting to heal becomes more of a risk/reward system, in particular. This chapter will implement a basic hunger clock for the player.
