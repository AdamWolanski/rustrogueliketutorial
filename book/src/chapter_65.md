There are still a few common item types that we aren't supporting, yet. This chapter will finish that up, and lay the framework for spellcasting (in the next chapter).

## Items that improve attributes

A common type of item frequently round in D&D-likes are items that enhance (or reduce!) your attributes. For example, *Gauntlets of Ogre Power* grant a might bonus or a *Hat of Wizardry* grants intelligence. We have most of the framework in place to support these items, so let's go the final mile to make them work! Open up `spawns.json`, and we'll define what the gauntlets might look like:

```json
{
    "name" : "Gauntlets of Ogre Power",
    "renderable": {
        "glyph" : "[",
        "fg" : "#00FF00",
        "bg" : "#000000",
        "order" : 2
    },
    "wearable" : {
        "slot" : "Hands",
        "armor_class" : 0.1,
        "might" : 5
    },
    "weight_lbs" : 1.0,
    "base_value" : 300.0,
    "initiative_penalty" : 0.0,
    "vendor_category" : "armor",
    "magic" : { "class" : "common", "naming" : "Unidentified Gauntlets" },
    "attributes" : { "might" : 5 }
}
```

Why didn't we just add this to "wearable"? We might want to grant an attribute boost to other things! To support loading this - and other attribute boosts - we need to edit `item_structs.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct Item {
    pub name : String,
    pub renderable : Option<Renderable>,
    pub consumable : Option<Consumable>,
    pub weapon : Option<Weapon>,
    pub wearable : Option<Wearable>,
    pub initiative_penalty : Option<f32>,
    pub weight_lbs : Option<f32>,
    pub base_value : Option<f32>,
    pub vendor_category : Option<String>,
    pub magic : Option<MagicItem>,
    pub attributes : Option<ItemAttributeBonus>
}
...
#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct ItemAttributeBonus {
    pub might : Option<i32>,
    pub fitness : Option<i32>,
    pub quickness : Option<i32>,
    pub intelligence : Option<i32>
}
```

As we've done before, we'll need a component to support this data. In `components.rs` (and registered in `main.rs` and `saveload_system.rs`):

```rust
#[derive(Component, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct AttributeBonus {
    pub might : Option<i32>,
    pub fitness : Option<i32>,
    pub quickness : Option<i32>,
    pub intelligence : Option<i32>
}
```

And we'll modify `raws/rawmaster.rs`'s function `spawn_named_item` to support adding this component type:

```rust
if let Some(ab) = &item_template.attributes {
    eb = eb.with(AttributeBonus{
        might : ab.might,
        fitness : ab.fitness,
        quickness : ab.quickness,
        intelligence : ab.intelligence,
    });
}
```

Now that the component can be applied to an item, lets put it into the spawn table as ridiculously common to make testing easy:

```json
{ "name" : "Gauntlets of Ogre Power", "weight" : 100, "min_depth" : 0, "max_depth" : 100 },
```

Finally, we need to make it actually do something. We're doing something very similar in `ai/encumbrance_system.rs` - so that's the natural place to slot it in. We'll add a lot to the system, so here's the whole thing:

```rust
extern crate specs;
use specs::prelude::*;
use crate::{EquipmentChanged, Item, InBackpack, Equipped, Pools, Attributes, gamelog::GameLog, AttributeBonus,
    gamesystem::attr_bonus};
use std::collections::HashMap;

pub struct EncumbranceSystem {}

impl<'a> System<'a> for EncumbranceSystem {
    #[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
    type SystemData = (
        WriteStorage<'a, EquipmentChanged>,
        Entities<'a>,
        ReadStorage<'a, Item>,
        ReadStorage<'a, InBackpack>,
        ReadStorage<'a, Equipped>,
        WriteStorage<'a, Pools>,
        WriteStorage<'a, Attributes>,
        ReadExpect<'a, Entity>,
        WriteExpect<'a, GameLog>,
        ReadStorage<'a, AttributeBonus>
    );

    fn run(&mut self, data : Self::SystemData) {
        let (mut equip_dirty, entities, items, backpacks, wielded,
            mut pools, mut attributes, player, mut gamelog, attrbonus) = data;

        if equip_dirty.is_empty() { return; }

        struct ItemUpdate {
            weight : f32,
            initiative : f32,
            might : i32,
            fitness : i32,
            quickness : i32,
            intelligence : i32
        }

        // Build the map of who needs updating
        let mut to_update : HashMap<Entity, ItemUpdate> = HashMap::new(); // (weight, intiative)
        for (entity, _dirty) in (&entities, &equip_dirty).join() {
            to_update.insert(entity, ItemUpdate{ weight: 0.0, initiative: 0.0, might: 0, fitness: 0, quickness: 0, intelligence: 0 });
        }

        // Remove all dirty statements
        equip_dirty.clear();

        // Total up equipped items
        for (item, equipped, entity) in (&items, &wielded, &entities).join() {
            if to_update.contains_key(&equipped.owner) {
                let totals = to_update.get_mut(&equipped.owner).unwrap();
                totals.weight += item.weight_lbs;
                totals.initiative += item.initiative_penalty;
                if let Some(attr) = attrbonus.get(entity) {
                    println!("Attr! {:?}", attr);
                    totals.might += attr.might.unwrap_or(0);
                    totals.fitness += attr.fitness.unwrap_or(0);
                    totals.quickness += attr.quickness.unwrap_or(0);
                    totals.intelligence += attr.intelligence.unwrap_or(0);
                }
            }
        }

        // Total up carried items
        for (item, carried, entity) in (&items, &backpacks, &entities).join() {
            if to_update.contains_key(&carried.owner) {
                let totals = to_update.get_mut(&carried.owner).unwrap();
                totals.weight += item.weight_lbs;
                totals.initiative += item.initiative_penalty;
            }
        }

        // Apply the data to Pools
        for (entity, item) in to_update.iter() {
            if let Some(pool) = pools.get_mut(*entity) {
                pool.total_weight = item.weight;
                pool.total_initiative_penalty = item.initiative;

                if let Some(attr) = attributes.get_mut(*entity) {
                    attr.might.modifiers = item.might;
                    attr.fitness.modifiers = item.fitness;
                    attr.quickness.modifiers = item.quickness;
                    attr.intelligence.modifiers = item.intelligence;
                    attr.might.bonus = attr_bonus(attr.might.base + attr.might.modifiers);
                    attr.fitness.bonus = attr_bonus(attr.fitness.base + attr.fitness.modifiers);
                    attr.quickness.bonus = attr_bonus(attr.quickness.base + attr.quickness.modifiers);
                    attr.intelligence.bonus = attr_bonus(attr.intelligence.base + attr.intelligence.modifiers);

                    let carry_capacity_lbs = (attr.might.base + attr.might.modifiers) * 15;
                    if pool.total_weight as i32 > carry_capacity_lbs {
                        // Overburdened
                        pool.total_initiative_penalty += 4.0;
                        if *entity == *player {
                            gamelog.entries.insert(0, "You are overburdened, and suffering an initiative penalty.".to_string());
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Charged items

Not all items crumble to dust when you use them. A potion vial might hold more than one dose, a magical rod might cast its effect multiple times (as usual, your imagination is the limit!). Let's make a new item, the *Rod Of Fireballs*. In `spawns.json`, we'll define the basics; it's basically a scroll of fireball, but with charges:

```json
{
    "name" : "Rod of Fireballs",
    "renderable": {
        "glyph" : "/",
        "fg" : "#FFAAAA",
        "bg" : "#000000",
        "order" : 2
    },
    "consumable" : {
        "effects" : { 
            "ranged" : "6",
            "damage" : "20",
            "area_of_effect" : "3",
            "particle" : "â–“;#FFA500;200.0"
        },
        "charges" : 5
    },
    "weight_lbs" : 0.5,
    "base_value" : 500.0,
    "vendor_category" : "alchemy",
    "magic" : { "class" : "common", "naming" : "Unidentified Rod" }
}
```

We'll need to extend the item definition in `raws/item_structs.rs` to handle the new data:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Debug)]
pub struct Consumable {
    pub effects : HashMap<String, String>,
    pub charges : Option<i32>
}
```

We'll also extend the `Consumable` component in `components.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Component, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Consumable {
    pub max_charges : i32,
    pub charges : i32
}
```

Note that we're storing both the max and the current number. That's so we can allow recharging later. We'll need to extend `raws/rawmaster.rs` to apply this information:

```rust
if let Some(consumable) = &item_template.consumable {
    let max_charges = consumable.charges.unwrap_or(1);
    eb = eb.with(crate::components::Consumable{ max_charges, charges : max_charges });
    apply_effects!(consumable.effects, eb);
}
```

Now we need to make consumables with charges make use of them. That means not self-destructing if `max_charges` is greater than 1, only firing if there are charges remaining, and decrementing the charge count after usage. Fortunately, this is an easy change to `effects/triggers.rs`'s `item_trigger` function:

```rust
pub fn item_trigger(creator : Option<Entity>, item: Entity, targets : &Targets, ecs: &mut World) {
    // Check charges
    if let Some(c) = ecs.write_storage::<Consumable>().get_mut(item) {
        if c.charges < 1 {
            // Cancel
            let mut gamelog = ecs.fetch_mut::<GameLog>();
            gamelog.entries.insert(0, format!("{} is out of charges!", ecs.read_storage::<Name>().get(item).unwrap().name));
            return;
        } else {
            c.charges -= 1;
        }
    }

    // Use the item via the generic system
    let did_something = event_trigger(creator, item, targets, ecs);

    // If it was a consumable, then it gets deleted
    if did_something {
        if let Some(c) = ecs.read_storage::<Consumable>().get(item) {
            if c.max_charges == 0 {
                ecs.entities().delete(item).expect("Delete Failed");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That gets you a multi-use Rod of Fireballs! However, we should have some way to let the player know if charges remain - to help out with item management. After all, it *really sucks* to point your rod at a mighty dragon and hear a "fut" sound as it eats you. We'll go into `gui.rs` and extend `get_item_display_name`:

```rust
pub fn get_item_display_name(ecs: &World, item : Entity) -> String {
    if let Some(name) = ecs.read_storage::<Name>().get(item) {
        if ecs.read_storage::<MagicItem>().get(item).is_some() {
            let dm = ecs.fetch::<crate::map::MasterDungeonMap>();
            if dm.identified_items.contains(&name.name) {
                if let Some(c) = ecs.read_storage::<Consumable>().get(item) {
                    if c.max_charges > 1 {
                        format!("{} ({})", name.name.clone(), c.charges).to_string()
                    } else {
                        name.name.clone()
                    }
                } else {
                    name.name.clone()
                }
            } else if let Some(obfuscated) = ecs.read_storage::<ObfuscatedName>().get(item) {
                obfuscated.name.clone()
            } else {
                "Unidentified magic item".to_string()
            }
        } else {
            name.name.clone()
        }

    } else {
        "Nameless item (bug)".to_string()
    }
}
```

## Status Effects

Right now, we're handling status effects on a case-by-base basis, and it's relatively unusual to apply them. Most deep roguelikes have *lots* of possible effects - ranging from hallucinating on mushrooms to moving at super speed after drinking some brown goop! We've left these until now because they dovetail nicely into the other things we've been doing in this chapter.

Up until this chapter, we've added *Confusion* as a tag to the target - and relied upon the tag to store the duration. That's not really in the spirit of an ECS! Rather, *Confusion* is an entity *effect* that applies to a *target* for a *duration* number of turns. As usual, examining the taxonomy is a great way to figure out what entity/component groups something should have. So we'll visit `components.rs` and make two new components (also registering them in `main.rs` and `saveload_system.rs`), and modify the `Confusion` component to match this:

```rust
#[derive(Component, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Confusion {}

#[derive(Component, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct Duration {
    pub turns : i32
}

#[derive(Component, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct StatusEffect {
    pub target : Entity
}
```

Also because we're storing an `Entity`, we need to write a wrapper to keep serialization happy:

```rust
// StatusEffect wrapper
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]
pub struct StatusEffectData<M>(M);

impl<M: Marker + Serialize> ConvertSaveload<M> for StatusEffect
where
    for<'de> M: Deserialize<'de>,
{
    type Data = StatusEffectData<M>;
    type Error = NoError;

    fn convert_into<F>(&self, mut ids: F) -> Result<Self::Data, Self::Error>
    where
        F: FnMut(Entity) -> Option<M>,
    {
        let marker = ids(self.target).unwrap();
        Ok(StatusEffectData(marker))
    }

    fn convert_from<F>(data: Self::Data, mut ids: F) -> Result<Self, Self::Error>
    where
        F: FnMut(M) -> Option<Entity>,
    {
        let entity = ids(data.0).unwrap();
        Ok(StatusEffect{target: entity})
    }
}
```

That's all well and good - but we've broken a few things! Everything that expected `Confusion` to have a `turns` field is now complaining.

We'll start in `raws/rawmaster.rs` and separate the effect from the duration:

```rust
"confusion" => {
    $eb = $eb.with(Confusion{});
    $eb = $eb.with(Duration{ turns: effect.1.parse::<i32>().unwrap() });
}
```

In `effects/triggers.rs` we'll make the duration take from the `Duration` component of the effect:

```rust
// Confusion
if let Some(confusion) = ecs.read_storage::<Confusion>().get(entity) {
    if let Some(duration) = ecs.read_storage::<Duration>().get(entity) {
        add_effect(creator, EffectType::Confusion{ turns : duration.turns }, targets.clone());
        did_something = true;
    }
}
```

We'll change `effects/damage.rs`'s confusion function to match the new scheme of things:

```rust
pub fn add_confusion(ecs: &mut World, effect: &EffectSpawner, target: Entity) {
    if let EffectType::Confusion{turns} = &effect.effect_type {
        ecs.create_entity()
            .with(StatusEffect{ target })
            .with(Confusion{})
            .with(Duration{ turns : *turns})
            .with(Name{ name : "Confusion".to_string() })
            .marked::<SimpleMarker<SerializeMe>>()
            .build();
    }
}
```

That leaves `ai/effect_status.rs`. We'll change this to no longer worry about durations at all, and simply check for the presence of an effect - and if its *Confusion*, take away the target's turn:

```rust
extern crate specs;
use specs::prelude::*;
use crate::{MyTurn, Confusion, RunState, StatusEffect};
use std::collections::HashSet;

pub struct TurnStatusSystem {}

impl<'a> System<'a> for TurnStatusSystem {
    #[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
    type SystemData = ( WriteStorage<'a, MyTurn>,
                        ReadStorage<'a, Confusion>,
                        Entities<'a>,
                        ReadExpect<'a, RunState>,
                        ReadStorage<'a, StatusEffect>
                    );

    fn run(&mut self, data : Self::SystemData) {
        let (mut turns, confusion, entities, runstate, statuses) = data;

        if *runstate != RunState::Ticking { return; }

        // Collect a set of all entities whose turn it is
        let mut entity_turns = HashSet::new();
        for (entity, _turn) in (&entities, &turns).join() {
            entity_turns.insert(entity);
        }

        // Find status effects affecting entities whose turn it is
        let mut not_my_turn : Vec<Entity> = Vec::new();
        for (effect_entity, status_effect) in (&entities, &statuses).join() {
            if entity_turns.contains(&status_effect.target) {
                // Skip turn for confusion
                if confusion.get(effect_entity).is_some() {
                    not_my_turn.push(status_effect.target);
                }
            }
        }

        for e in not_my_turn {
            turns.remove(e);
        }
    }
}
```

If you `cargo run`, this will work - but there's one glaring problem: once confused, you are confused *forever* (or until someone puts you out of your misery). That's not quite what we had in mind. We've de-coupled the effect's duration from the effect taking place (which is a good thing!), but that means we have to handle durations!

Here's an interesting conundrum: status effects are there own entities, but don't have an *Initiative*. Turns are relative, since entities can operate at different speeds. So when do we want to handle duration? The answer is *the player's turn*; time may be relative, but from the player's point of view turns are quite well defined. In effect, the rest of the world is speeding up when you are slowed - because we don't want to force the player to sit and be bored while the world chugs around them. Since we are switching to player control in the `ai/initiative_system.rs` - we'll handle it in there:

```rust
extern crate specs;
use specs::prelude::*;
use crate::{Initiative, Position, MyTurn, Attributes, RunState, Pools, Duration, 
    EquipmentChanged, StatusEffect};

pub struct InitiativeSystem {}

impl<'a> System<'a> for InitiativeSystem {
    #[allow(clippy::type_complexity)]
    type SystemData = ( WriteStorage<'a, Initiative>,
                        ReadStorage<'a, Position>,
                        WriteStorage<'a, MyTurn>,
                        Entities<'a>,
                        WriteExpect<'a, rltk::RandomNumberGenerator>,
                        ReadStorage<'a, Attributes>,
                        WriteExpect<'a, RunState>,
                        ReadExpect<'a, Entity>,
                        ReadExpect<'a, rltk::Point>,
                        ReadStorage<'a, Pools>,
                        WriteStorage<'a, Duration>,
                        WriteStorage<'a, EquipmentChanged>,
                        ReadStorage<'a, StatusEffect>
                    );

    fn run(&mut self, data : Self::SystemData) {
        let (mut initiatives, positions, mut turns, entities, mut rng, attributes,
            mut runstate, player, player_pos, pools, mut durations, mut dirty,
            statuses) = data;

        if *runstate != RunState::Ticking { return; }

        // Clear any remaining MyTurn we left by mistkae
        turns.clear();

        // Roll initiative
