I'd like to suggest dark incantations and candles to breathe life into NPCs, but in reality - it's more code. We don't want our bystanders to stand around, dumb as rocks anymore. They don't have to behave particularly sensibly, but it would be good if they at least roam around a bit (other than vendors, that gets annoying - "where did the blacksmith go?") and tell you about their day.

## New components - dividing vendors from bystanders

First, we're going to make a new component - the `Vendor`.
