In the previous chapter, we built the layout of our town. In this chapter, we'll populate it with NPCs and Props. We'll introduce some new AI types to handle friendly or neutral NPCs, and begin placing merchants, townsfolk and other residents to make the town come alive. We'll also begin placing furniture and items to make the place feel less barren.
