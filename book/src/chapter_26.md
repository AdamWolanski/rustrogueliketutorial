In the last chapter, we used binary space partition (BSP) to build a dungeon with rooms. BSP is flexible, and can help you with a lot of problems; in this example, we're going to modify BSP to design an interior dungeon - completely inside a rectangular structure (for example, a castle) and with no wasted space other than interior walls.
